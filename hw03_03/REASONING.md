# Reasoning

This document serves for adding reasoning to the choices
made throughout the assignment implementation and for other observations.

## Router/web framework choice

I chose `net/http` if i had to implement some more endpoints and auth as well then i would propably go with some other framework. But for this assignment i went with `net/http` as i wanted to get more fammiliar with it being the standart library. I liked that it was simple and easy.

## Recomendations algo

I chose to create arbitrary scores and then sort the possible films via this score. Its not that complicated and its quite nice id say.

## load_data.sh

A simple `.sh` script that loads few reviews into the storage. **Verry usefull for testing.**
