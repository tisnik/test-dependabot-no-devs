# Reasoning

This document serves for adding reasoning to the choices
made throughout the assignment implementation and for other observations.

## Router/web framework choice

I have chosen `chi` because it was used in `todos` code that was provided to us
so if I didnt know anything I could have checked it with that. Documentation looks
alos solid and well made which was another reason. Also I have used go's net/http
for basic read and write.
